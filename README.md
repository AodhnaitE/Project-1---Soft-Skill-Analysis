***Solo Project: Soft Skill Analysis***

**_Objective:_**

The objective of this project was to find out what soft skills employers look for when hiring data analysts. Prior to beginning my comparative research, I derived three questions that I felt had to be answered before beginning this project. They were as follows.
1.	What is a Soft Skill
2.	Who are the potential employers?
3.	Identify Job advertisements relating to data analyst vacancies.
 To answer these questions, I used generic Google searches and complied the most popular answers. I also utilised job hiring sites such as indeed and glassdoor. 

**_Soft Skill Sets:_**

Through market research I identified 5 soft skill sets that I feel are the most popular with employers I have determined this from the frequency in which these skill sets have appeared through my cluster analysis. These skills sets are shown below.

1.	Communication Skills
2.	Work Ethic
3.	Time Management 
4.	Interpersonal Skills
5.	Teamwork Skills

I will explain these soft skill sets in more detail in my presentation; these skills set will be drive my analysis and I will use this metric to evaluate what soft skills employers look for when hiring data analysts.

**_Research questions_**

1.	On average how many Job advertisements contain ‘soft skills’
2.	What soft skill set is most important to employers when hiring data analysts 
3.	Do certain sectors favour more ‘soft skills’ other overs or all sectors the same
